# Results

Results will be added as experiments are completed.

## Metrics

| Metric | Description | Note |
|--------|-------------|------|
| PESQ | Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality | May require licensed implementation |
| STOI | Short-Time Objective Intelligibility | Primary metric |
| SI-SDR | Scale-Invariant Signal-to-Distortion Ratio | Primary metric |

Note: PESQ may require licensed implementations depending on environment; SI-SDR and STOI are primary metrics.
