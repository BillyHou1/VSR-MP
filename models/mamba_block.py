# Dominic + Zhenning
# What this file does:
# This is where the actual denoising happens. Mamba scans along time and frequency
# to clean up the audio spectrogram. Think of it like an RNN that goes through
# the spectrogram row by row for time and column by column for frequency.
#
# What you need to do
# 1.Fix the imports cause they break on mamba-ssm 2.3.0 and the whole thing won't run
# 2.Let MambaBlock run forward-only, right now it always does forward+backward
# 3.Add a helper so we can switch between Mamba1 and Mamba2 from config
# 4.Add CausalTFMambaBlock — this is the main thing, it's what LiteAVSEMamba actually uses
#
# Why CausalTFMambaBlock matters:
# Real-time speech enhancement cannot look into the future. You cannot wait for
# someone to finish talking before you start denoising. So the time dimension
# has to be causal, meaning forward-only. But frequency is different — 100Hz and 4kHz
# exist at the same time, there is no "future" in frequency — so frequency stays
# bidirectional. This is one of the key differences from the original SEMamba.
#
# Recommended order: do 1 first, otherwise nothing runs, then 2 and 4 together, and 3 last.

# this is the block that LiteAVSEMamba actually uses, generator.py imports it
# it is almost identical to TFMambaBlock above, you can just copy it and change two things
# 1.time_mamba uses bidirectional=False (causal cannot see future frames)
#    freq_mamba uses bidirectional=True (frequency has no causality, same as before)
# 2.because causal mamba outputs C instead of 2C, tlinear becomes C->C not 2C->C
#    flinear stays 2C->C cause freq is still bidirectional
#
# the forward() logic is exactly the same as TFMambaBlock, nothing changes there input and output shape: [B, 64, T, F] -> [B, 64, T, F]
